=====================

This maths-based (quantitative) asset allocation (stocks and bonds) is based on something I wrote up some time ago: http://mathieu.bouville.name/finance/CAPE/ . I had initially done it in Excel and am now switching to R.

## Anybody can use it...
Such asset allocation is suitable for normal, non-professional investors:
- it is based solely on dynamic changes to the stockâ€“bond allocation;
- there is no short position; 
- there is no stock-picking; 
- there is no leverage; 
- there are no asset classes other than stocks and bonds; 
- the strategies use only data that are publically available.

## ... but not anybody can create it
Coming up with the strategies on the other hand is more involved: 
- knowledge of finance, maths, programming;
- finding more data (e.g. so far I have data only for the U.S.);
- coming up with new ideas (or reusing other people's);
- testing a wide range of parameters for these strategies and keeping the best ones.

## Current status
I switched to R recently and the code needs a bit of cleaning before it can be used by someone not in my mind. I hope to upload it early June.
